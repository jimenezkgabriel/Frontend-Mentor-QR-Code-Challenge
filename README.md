1. How did using Figma designs as references affect your coding process?

I was able to inspect the exact color values, the exact width, the exact border radius number, and even exact padding size using Figma and inspecting the content.

2. What challenges did you encounter when aligning your code with the design specifications?

I wanted to have my content centered on the screen without the use of a flexbox or grid. Luckily, a simple margin: auto; fixed that. Oh, and there was an issue in keeping the QR image within the bounds of the card but I managed to solve it (googling it).

3. How can the feedback and community resources on Frontend Mentor help you improve as a developer?

What always comes to mind when reviewing new solutions is "How can I do this alignment or CSS trick simpler or more elegant? Less code?" That's how reviewing new solutions help you discover new and easier ways to do the same things.
